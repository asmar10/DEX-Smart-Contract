# DEX-Smart-Contract
This contract is an implementation of a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum that allows users to trade LP (LPT) tokens, add liquidity, remove liquidity, and swap between ETH and ERC20 tokens.

# Requirements

- Build an exchange that allows swapping ETH <> TOKEN

- DEX must charge a 1% fee on swaps

- When user adds liquidity, they must be given an LP Token that represents their share of the pool

- LP must be able to burn their LP tokens to receive back ETH and TOKEN
